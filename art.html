                Michigan State University, explained in a <a
                    href="https://www.govtech.com/computing/Understanding-the-Four-Types-of-Artificial-Intelligence.html"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 article</a> that AI can be categorized into four types,
                beginning with the task-specific intelligent systems in wide use today and progressing to sentient
                systems, which do not yet exist. The categories are as follows:</p>
            <ul class="default-list">
                <li><strong>Type 1: Reactive machines.</strong> These AI systems have no memory and are task specific.
                    An example is Deep Blue, the <a
                        href="https://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/definition/IBM-International-Business-Machines">IBM</a>
                    chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on the chessboard
                    and make predictions, but because it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform future
                    ones.</li>
                <li><strong>Type 2: Limited memory.</strong> These AI systems have memory, so they can use past
                    experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in <a
                        href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/driverless-car">self-driving cars</a>
                    are designed this way.</li>
                <li><strong>Type 3: Theory of mind.</strong> Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it

            <p>Arend Hintze, an assistant professor of integrative biology and computer science and engineering at
                Michigan State University, explained in a <a
                    href="https://www.govtech.com/computing/Understanding-the-Four-Types-of-Artificial-Intelligence.html"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 article</a> that AI can be categorized into four types,
                beginning with the task-specific intelligent systems in wide use today and progressing to sentient
                systems, which do not yet exist. The categories are as follows:</p>
            <ul class="default-list">
                <li><strong>Type 1: Reactive machines.</strong> These AI systems have no memory and are task specific.
                    An example is Deep Blue, the <a
                        href="https://searchitchannel.techtarget.com/definition/IBM-International-Business-Machines">IBM</a>
                    chess program that beat Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. Deep Blue can identify pieces on the chessboard
                    and make predictions, but because it has no memory, it cannot use past experiences to inform future
                    ones.</li>
                <li><strong>Type 2: Limited memory.</strong> These AI systems have memory, so they can use past
                    experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in <a
                        href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/driverless-car">self-driving cars</a>
                    are designed this way.</li>
                <li><strong>Type 3: Theory of mind.</strong> Theory of mind is a psychology term. When applied to AI, it
                    means that the system would have the social intelligence to understand emotions. This type of AI
                    will be able to infer human intentions and predict behavior, a necessary skill for AI systems to
                    become integral members of human teams.</li>
                <li><strong>Type 4:</strong> <strong>Self-awareness.</strong> In this category, AI systems have a sense
                    of self, which gives them consciousness. Machines with self-awareness understand their own current
                    state. This type of AI does not yet exist.</li>

            <h3 class="section-title"><i class="icon" data-icon="1"></i>Examples of AI technology</h3>
            <p>AI is incorporated into a variety of different types of technology. Here are six examples:</p>
            <ul class="default-list">
                <li><strong>Automation.</strong> When paired with AI technologies, automation tools can expand the
                    volume and types of tasks performed. An example is robotic process automation (<a
                        href="https://internetofthingsagenda.techtarget.com/definition/robotic-process-automation">RPA</a>),
                    a type of software that automates repetitive, rules-based data processing tasks traditionally done
                    by humans. When combined with machine learning and emerging AI tools, RPA can automate bigger
                    portions of enterprise jobs, enabling RPA's tactical bots to pass along intelligence from AI and
                    respond to process changes.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine learning.</strong> This is the science of getting a computer to act without
                    programming. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that, in very simple terms, can be
                    thought of as the automation of predictive analytics. There are three types of machine learning
                    algorithms:</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="default-list">
                <ul class="default-list">
                    <li><a href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/supervised-learning"><strong>Supervised
                                learning</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Data sets are labeled so that patterns can be
                        detected and used to label new data sets.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/unsupervised-learning"><strong>Unsupervised
                                learning</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Data sets aren't labeled and are sorted
                        according to similarities or differences.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/reinforcement-learning"><strong>Reinforcement
                                learning</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Data sets aren't labeled but, after performing
                        an action or several actions, the AI system is given feedback.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul class="default-list">
                <li><strong>Machine vision.</strong> This technology gives a machine the ability to see. <a
                        href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/machine-vision-computer-vision">Machine
                        vision</a> captures and analyzes visual information using a camera, analog-to-digital conversion
                    and digital signal processing. It is often compared to human eyesight, but machine vision isn't
                    bound by biology and can be programmed to see through walls, for example. It is used in a range of
                    applications from signature identification to medical image analysis. <a
                        href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/ehandbook/Computer-vision-AI-looks-beyond-the-narrow-into-the-mainstream">Computer
                        vision</a>, which is focused on machine-based image processing, is often conflated with machine
                    vision.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural language processing.</strong> This is the processing of human language by a computer
                    program. One of the older and &nbsp;best-known examples of NLP is spam detection, which looks at the
                    subject line and text of an email and decides if it's junk. Current approaches to NLP are based on
                    machine learning. NLP tasks include text translation, sentiment analysis and speech recognition.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Robotics.</strong> This field of engineering focuses on the design and manufacturing of
                    robots. Robots are often used to perform tasks that are difficult for humans to perform or perform
                    consistently. For example, robots are used in assembly lines for car production or by NASA to move
                    large objects in space. Researchers are also using machine learning to build robots that can
                    interact in social settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Self-driving cars.</strong> Autonomous vehicles use a combination of computer vision, <a
                        href="https://searchenterpriseai.techtarget.com/definition/image-recognition">image
                        recognition</a> and deep learning to build automated skill at piloting a vehicle while staying
                    in a given lane and avoiding unexpected obstructions, such as pedestrians.</li>
